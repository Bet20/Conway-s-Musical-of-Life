# Conway's Game of life with sound (Musical of Life)

Following the examples in the [Odin](https://github.com/odin-lang/examples/tree/master/raylib/game_of_life) Repo to get better at it.
This version will not have any sort of controls besides muting the program.
The ideia is to make the music sound somewhat pleasurable so it can be a screensaver-like program to relax.

Using Odin + Raylib
